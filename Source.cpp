TODO:
* This C++ utility takes a key framed vertex data texture in BMP format
 * it takes params:
 * it spits out a BMP and glsl and hlsl (?)
* Watch this:  https://vimeo.com/200526114
* get more sim data?
 * particles following physical paths
 * destructed object
 * can we get a stable mesh fluid sim?
? have a way to make inactive verts go straight to origin (some extra channel to multiply by maybe?)

* WebGL Demo:
 * make a demo that can compare the source, as well as other versions compressed with other parameters
 

Blog Post:
* explain how it works
* explain how to use it
* link to demo with screenshots
* talk about how mesh has to be consistent from frame to frame
* link to...
